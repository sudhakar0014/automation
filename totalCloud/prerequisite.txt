Please follow instructions carefully.
I have created ansible scripts to install kubernetes in worker node, Creating the cluster and Attaching worker nodes to master
Since we have ansible scripts we will required ansible  in the Ec2 machine.

1. Please follow below Link to install Ansible
   Ansible: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-ansible-on-ubuntu-18-04

2. We need to install Docker and Kubernetes in EC2 machine. Please follow below urls.
   Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
   Kubernetes: https://computingforgeeks.com/deploy-kubernetes-cluster-on-ubuntu-with-kubeadm/

3. Please Update the IPs in "inventory" file 

4. Pleaes make sure Master Ec2 Instance Can access other 2 nodes(Worker Ec2 Machine) via ssh(Using Ssh keys). 
   [Note: If ansible and Kubernetes are in same Ec2 instance then it should able to access itself via ssh]

5. After following above instructions carefully master node will have ansible, docker and kubernetes and it will be able to 
   access other worker nodes via ssh including itself.

6. Use below commands to varify  prerequisite setup.
   inventory validation:
   command:  ansible-inventory -i inventory --list -y 
   
   Reachablity:
   command: ansible all -i inventory -m ping
